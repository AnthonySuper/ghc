The @String@ in the @PrimOpInfos@ is the ``base name'' by which the user may
refer to the primitive operation.  The conventional \tr{#}-for-
unboxed ops is added on later.

The reason for the funny characters in the names is so we do not
interfere with the programmer's Haskell name spaces.

We use @PrimKinds@ for the ``type'' information, because they're
(slightly) more convenient to use than @TyCons@.

Here are a load of comments from the old primOp info:

A @Word#@ is an unsigned @Int#@.

@decodeFloat#@ is given w/ Integer-stuff (it's similar).

@decodeDouble#@ is given w/ Integer-stuff (it's similar).

Decoding of floating-point numbers is sorta Integer-related.  Encoding
is done with plain ccalls now (see PrelNumExtra.hs).

A @Weak@ Pointer is created by the @mkWeak#@ primitive:

        mkWeak# :: k -> v -> f -> State# RealWorld
                        -> (# State# RealWorld, Weak# v #)

In practice, you'll use the higher-level

        data Weak v = Weak# v
        mkWeak :: k -> v -> IO () -> IO (Weak v)

The following operation dereferences a weak pointer.  The weak pointer
may have been finalized, so the operation returns a result code which
must be inspected before looking at the dereferenced value.

        deRefWeak# :: Weak# v -> State# RealWorld ->
                        (# State# RealWorld, v, Int# #)

Only look at v if the Int# returned is /= 0 !!

The higher-level op is

        deRefWeak :: Weak v -> IO (Maybe v)

Weak pointers can be finalized early by using the finalize# operation:

        finalizeWeak# :: Weak# v -> State# RealWorld ->
                           (# State# RealWorld, Int#, IO () #)

The Int# returned is either

        0 if the weak pointer has already been finalized, or it has no
          finalizer (the third component is then invalid).

        1 if the weak pointer is still alive, with the finalizer returned
          as the third component.

A {\em stable name/pointer} is an index into a table of stable name
entries.  Since the garbage collector is told about stable pointers,
it is safe to pass a stable pointer to external systems such as C
routines.

\begin{verbatim}
makeStablePtr#  :: a -> State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, StablePtr# a #)
freeStablePtr   :: StablePtr# a -> State# RealWorld -> State# RealWorld
deRefStablePtr# :: StablePtr# a -> State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)
eqStablePtr#    :: StablePtr# a -> StablePtr# a -> Int#
\end{verbatim}

It may seem a bit surprising that @makeStablePtr#@ is a @IO@
operation since it doesn't (directly) involve IO operations.  The
reason is that if some optimisation pass decided to duplicate calls to
@makeStablePtr#@ and we only pass one of the stable pointers over, a
massive space leak can result.  Putting it into the IO monad
prevents this.  (Another reason for putting them in a monad is to
ensure correct sequencing wrt the side-effecting @freeStablePtr@
operation.)

An important property of stable pointers is that if you call
makeStablePtr# twice on the same object you get the same stable
pointer back.

Note that we can implement @freeStablePtr#@ using @_ccall_@ (and,
besides, it's not likely to be used from Haskell) so it's not a
primop.

Question: Why @RealWorld@ - won't any instance of @_ST@ do the job? [ADR]

Stable Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A stable name is like a stable pointer, but with three important differences:

        (a) You can't deRef one to get back to the original object.
        (b) You can convert one to an Int.
        (c) You don't need to 'freeStableName'

The existence of a stable name doesn't guarantee to keep the object it
points to alive (unlike a stable pointer), hence (a).

Invariants:

        (a) makeStableName always returns the same value for a given
            object (same as stable pointers).

        (b) if two stable names are equal, it implies that the objects
            from which they were created were the same.

        (c) stableNameToInt always returns the same Int for a given
            stable name.


These primops are pretty weird.

        tagToEnum# :: Int -> a    (result type must be an enumerated type)

The constraints aren't currently checked by the front end, but the
code generator will fall over if they aren't satisfied.

{- Note [Classification by PrimOpEffect]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some primops have effects that are not captured entirely by their result value.
We distinguish these cases:

  * NoEffect: Pure primop, like `plusInt#`.
  * ReadEffect: A read-only primop, like `readMutVar#`, if it wasn't for #3207.
  * ThrowsImprecise: Possibly throws an *imprecise* exception, like
    division-by-zero or a segfault arising from an out of bounds array access.
    An imprecise exception is an outright error and transformations may play
    fast and loose by turning one imprecise exception into another, or bottom.
    See Note [Precise vs imprecise exceptions] in GHC.Types.Demand.
  * WriteEffect: A write side-effect, either writing to the RealWorld (IO) or
    to a mutable variable (`writeMutVar#`).
  * ThrowsPrecise: Possibly throws a *precise* exception. `raiseIO#` is the
    only primop that does that.
    See Note [Precise vs imprecise exceptions] in GHC.Types.Demand.

Why is this classification necessary? Because the kind of effect a primop
performs influences the transformations we are allowed to apply to it.
For example let binding a division-by-zero (which `ThrowsImprecise`) might
violate Core's let/app invariant (see Note [Core let/app invariant] in
GHC.Core) which is critical to the simplifier's ability to float without fear
of changing program meaning.

See Note [Transformations affected by PrimOpEffect].

Note [Transformations affected by PrimOpEffect]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The PrimOpEffect of a primop affects applicability of program transformations
in the following way.
Summary table is followed by details.

           | NoEff. | ReadEff. | ThrowsImp. | WriteEff. | ThrowsPrec. |
Discard    | YES    | YES      | YES        | NO        | NO          |
Dupe       | YES    | NO^[1]   | NO^[1]     | NO        | NO          |
Defer      | YES    | YES      | YES        | YES       | NO          |
Speculate  | YES    | YES      | NO         | NO        | NO          |

[1] This is only due to #3207, and should only apply to read effects that can
be interleaved with write effects (e.g. mutable arrays as opposed to immutable
ones). More details below.

Note how there is a total order on effects in terms of which program
tranformations they inhibit. A "stronger" effect means less transformations
are sound to apply to it. NoEffect means any tranformation is sound;
ThrowsPrecise means none of the following is.
Whether or not a primop is cheap to evaluate is an orthogonal concern.

* Discarding.   case (a `op` b) of _ -> rhs  ===>   rhs
  You should not discard a WriteEffect or ThrowsPrecise primop; e.g.
     case (writeIntArray# a i v s of (# _, _ #) -> True
  Arguably you should be able to discard this, since the returned state token
  is not used, but that relies on NEVER inlining unsafePerformIO, and
  programmers sometimes write this kind of stuff by hand (#9390).  So we
  (conservatively) never discard such a primop.
  The situation with ThrowsPrecise primops such as raiseIO# is even more
  restrictive: We may never discard a side effect throwing a precise exception.

  However, it's fine to discard a ThrowsImprecise primop.  For example
     case (indexIntArray# a i) of _ -> True
  We can discard indexIntArray#; it might throw an imprecise segmentation
  fault, but no precise exception, so we are OK with not observing it.
  See #5658 which was all about this.
  Similarly (a `/#` b) can be discarded.  It can seg-fault or cause a hardware
  exception, but not a precise Haskell exception.
  It's obviously fine to discard a ReadEffect if its result aren't used.

* Duplication.  Example: The Simplifier inlines a (multi occ) binding.
  You cannot duplicate any effectful primop participating in state token
  threading. Not even what is actually a read-only effect like `readMutVar#`,
  see #3207.
  You might wonder how that can be problematic, but just look at
  Control.Monad.ST.Lazy.Imp.strictToLazy!  We get something like this
        p = case readMutVar# s v of
              (# s', r #) -> (S# s', r)
        s' = case p of (s', r) -> s'
        r  = case p of (s', r) -> r

  (All these bindings are boxed.)  If we inline p at its two call
  sites, we get a catastrophe: because the read is performed once when
  s' is demanded, and once when 'r' is demanded, which may be much
  later.  Utterly wrong.  #3207 is real example of this happening.

  If it wasn't for working around state token threading
  (see https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/3207#note_257470 for other
  approaches), then duplication wouldn't be an issue at all, soundness-wise.
  But for the time being, we mark primops that participate in state token
  threading such as `readMutVar#` (a ReadEffect at heart) and `readArray#`
  (ThrowsImprecise) as WriteEffect and say that we may not duplicate
  WriteEffect.

* Deferring.  Example: FloatIn, here inside a single-alt case:
     case (a `op` b) of (# s, x #) -> case e of p -> rhs
     ==>
     case e of p -> case (a `op` b) of (# s, x #) -> rhs
  Note that e might diverge (or throw an imprecise exception) and thus the
  side-effect we would observe by evaluating op might not happen if we defer it
  after e.

  That is a problem if op ThrowsPrecise: If e diverges, the user can catch
  the precise exception /before/ FloatIn, but not afterwards. Hence we may not
  float in a ThrowsPrecise primop like raiseIO#.

  But since e can never throw an imprecise exception, there is no
  non-imprecise-exceptional control flow in which it is possible to observe
  that a WriteEffect (and anything "weaker") didn't happen. So it's OK to
  defer (every weaker than or equal to) write effects. So you can float a
  WriteEffect *inwards*, but not inside a lambda (see Duplication below [SG: It
  isn't obvious to me how that explains why we shouldn't float inside a lambda
  at all]).

* Speculating.  Example: Float out.
  You must not float a ThrowsImprecise primop *outwards* lest you escape the
  dynamic scope of the test.  Example:
      case d ># 0# of
        True  -> case x /# d of r -> r +# 1
        False -> 0
  Here we must not float the division outwards to give
      case x/# d of r ->
      case d ># 0# of
        True  -> r +# 1
        False -> 0
  Now the potential division by zero will be performed in both branches.

  Similarly you can't float out a (stronger) WriteEffect primop.  For example:
       if blah then case writeMutVar# v True s0 of (# s1 #) -> s1
               else s0
  Notice that s0 is mentioned in both branches of the 'if', but
  only one of these two will actually be consumed.  But if we
  float out to
      case writeMutVar# v True s0 of (# s1 #) ->
      if blah then s1 else s0
  the writeMutVar will be performed in both branches, which is
  utterly wrong.

  It's OK to speculate read effects such as readMutVar#, though, because
  they can't move before a i.e. write effect purely by data dependency on the
  state token.

Note [Implementation: how can_fail/has_side_effects affect transformations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do we ensure that that floating/duplication/discarding are done right
in the simplifier?

Two main predicates on primpops test these flags:
  primOpOkForSideEffects <=> not has_side_effects
  primOpOkForSpeculation <=> not (has_side_effects || can_fail)

  * The "no-float-out" thing is achieved by ensuring that we never
    let-bind a can_fail or has_side_effects primop.  The RHS of a
    let-binding (which can float in and out freely) satisfies
    exprOkForSpeculation; this is the let/app invariant.  And
    exprOkForSpeculation is false of can_fail and has_side_effects.

  * So can_fail and has_side_effects primops will appear only as the
    scrutinees of cases, and that's why the FloatIn pass is capable
    of floating case bindings inwards.

  * The no-duplicate thing is done via primOpIsCheap, by making
    has_side_effects things (very very very) not-cheap!

{- Note [Primop wrappers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously hasNoBinding would claim that PrimOpIds didn't have a curried
function definition. This caused quite some trouble as we would be forced to
eta expand unsaturated primop applications very late in the Core pipeline. Not
only would this produce unnecessary thunks, but it would also result in nasty
inconsistencies in CAFfy-ness determinations (see #16846 and
Note [CAFfyness inconsistencies due to late eta expansion] in GHC.Iface.Tidy).

However, it was quite unnecessary for hasNoBinding to claim this; primops in
fact *do* have curried definitions which are found in GHC.PrimopWrappers, which
is auto-generated by utils/genprimops from prelude/primops.txt.pp. These wrappers
are standard Haskell functions mirroring the types of the primops they wrap.
For instance, in the case of plusInt# we would have:

    module GHC.PrimopWrappers where
    import GHC.Prim as P
    plusInt# a b = P.plusInt# a b

We now take advantage of these curried definitions by letting hasNoBinding
claim that PrimOpIds have a curried definition and then rewrite any unsaturated
PrimOpId applications that we find during CoreToStg as applications of the
associated wrapper (e.g. `GHC.Prim.plusInt# 3#` will get rewritten to
`GHC.PrimopWrappers.plusInt# 3#`).` The Id of the wrapper for a primop can be
found using 'PrimOp.primOpWrapperId'.

Nota Bene: GHC.PrimopWrappers is needed *regardless*, because it's
used by GHCi, which does not implement primops direct at all.
