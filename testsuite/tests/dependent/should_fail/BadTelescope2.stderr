    These kind and type variables: a k (b :: k)
    are out of dependency order. Perhaps try this ordering:
      k (a :: k) (b :: k)
    In the type signature for ‘foo’:
      foo :: forall a k (b :: k). SameKind a b

BadTelescope2.hs:13:8: error:
    The kind of implicitly-bound variable ‘b’, namely ‘Proxy a’,
    depends on explicitly-bound variable ‘a’
    Perhaps bind ‘b’ explicitly sometime after binding ‘a’
    In the type signature for ‘bar’:
      bar :: forall a (c :: Proxy b) (d :: Proxy a).
             Proxy c -> SameKind b d
