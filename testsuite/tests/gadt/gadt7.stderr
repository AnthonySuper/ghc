    Couldn't match expected type ‘_r’ with actual type ‘_r1’
      ‘_r1’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints (_t ~ Int)
        bound by a pattern with constructor

      ‘_r1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
            the inferred type of i1b :: T _t -> _r1 -> _r at gadt7.hs:16:1
      ‘_r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of i1b :: T _t -> _r1 -> _r at gadt7.hs:16:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘i1b’
    Relevant bindings include
      y1 :: _r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:16)
      y :: _r1 (bound at gadt7.hs:16:7)
      i1b :: T _t -> _r1 -> _r (bound at gadt7.hs:16:1)
    In the expression: y1
    In a case alternative: K -> y1
