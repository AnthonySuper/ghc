    Couldn't match type ‘_r’ with ‘ExpGADT Int’
      ‘_r’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints (t ~ Int)
        bound by a pattern with constructor
                   ExpInt :: Int -> ExpGADT Int,
                 in a case alternative
        at gadt-escape1.hs:19:43-50
      ‘_r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of weird1 :: _r at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘weird1’
       Expected type: _r
         Actual type: ExpGADT t
    Relevant bindings include
      weird1 :: _r (bound at gadt-escape1.hs:19:1)
    In the expression: a
    In a case alternative: Hidden (ExpInt _) a -> a
