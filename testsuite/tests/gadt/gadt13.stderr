    Couldn't match expected type ‘_r’
                with actual type ‘String -> [Char]’
      ‘_r’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints (_r1 ~ Int)
        bound by a pattern with constructor
                   I :: Int -> Term Int,
                 in an equation for ‘shw’
        at gadt13.hs:15:6-8
      ‘_r’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of shw :: Term _r1 -> _r at gadt13.hs:15:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘shw’
    Relevant bindings include
      shw :: Term _r1 -> _r (bound at gadt13.hs:15:1)
    In the expression: ("I " ++) . shows t
    In an equation for ‘shw’: shw (I t) = ("I " ++) . shows t
