    Couldn't match expected type ‘r0’
                with actual type ‘String -> [Char]’
      ‘r0’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints (r1 ~ Int)
        bound by a pattern with constructor
                   I :: Int -> Term Int,
                 in an equation for ‘shw’
        at gadt13.hs:15:6-8
      ‘r0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of shw :: Term r1 -> r0 at gadt13.hs:15:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘shw’
    Relevant bindings include
      shw :: Term r1 -> r0 (bound at gadt13.hs:15:1)
    In the expression: ("I " ++) . shows t
    In an equation for ‘shw’: shw (I t) = ("I " ++) . shows t
