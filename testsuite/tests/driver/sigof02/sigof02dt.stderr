    Couldn't match expected type ‘MapAsSet.Map _k _a’
                with actual type ‘Map.Map Int [Char]’
    NB: ‘MapAsSet.Map’ is defined in ‘MapAsSet’
        ‘Map.Map’ is defined in ‘Map’
    In the first argument of ‘keysSet’, namely ‘x’
    In the first argument of ‘print’, namely ‘(keysSet x)’
