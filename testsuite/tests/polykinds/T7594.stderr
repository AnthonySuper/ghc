    Couldn't match type ‘t’ with ‘IO ()’
      ‘t’ is untouchable
        inside the constraints ((:&:) c0 Real a)
        bound by a type expected by the context: (:&:) c0 Real a => a -> t
        at T7594.hs:33:8-19
      ‘t’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the inferred type of bar2 :: t at T7594.hs:33:1
    Possible fix: add a type signature for ‘bar2’
    Expected type: a -> t
      Actual type: a -> IO ()
    Relevant bindings include bar2 :: t (bound at T7594.hs:33:1)
    In the first argument of ‘app’, namely ‘print’
    In the expression: app print q2
