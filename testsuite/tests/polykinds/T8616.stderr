    Couldn't match type ‘k1’ with ‘*’
    ‘k1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the type signature for:
           withSomeSing :: Proxy kproxy
         at T8616.hs:7:35
    When matching types
      Any :: k1
      Proxy kproxy :: *
       Expected type: Proxy kproxy
         Actual type: Any
    Relevant bindings include
      withSomeSing :: Proxy kproxy (bound at T8616.hs:8:1)
    In the expression: undefined :: (Any :: k)
    In an equation for ‘withSomeSing’:
        withSomeSing = undefined :: (Any :: k)
