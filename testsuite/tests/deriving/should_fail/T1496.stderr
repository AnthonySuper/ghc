    Couldn't match representation of type ‘c1 Int’
                             with that of ‘c1 Moo’
    arising from the coercion of the method ‘isInt’
      from type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Int’
        to type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c Int -> c Moo’
    NB: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c1’ have;
      we must assume that the role is nominal
    When deriving the instance for (IsInt Moo)
