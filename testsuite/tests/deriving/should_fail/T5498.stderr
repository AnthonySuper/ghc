    Couldn't match representation of type ‘c1 a’
                             with that of ‘c1 (Down a)’
    arising from the coercion of the method ‘intIso’
      from type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c a -> c Int’
        to type ‘forall (c :: * -> *). c (Down a) -> c Int’
    Relevant role signatures: type role Down representational
    NB: We cannot know what roles the parameters to ‘c1’ have;
      we must assume that the role is nominal
    When deriving the instance for (IntIso (Down a))
