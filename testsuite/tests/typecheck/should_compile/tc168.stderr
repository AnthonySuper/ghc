tc168.hs:17:1:
    Could not deduce (C a (t, b0))
      arising from the ambiguity check for ‘g’
    from the context (C a (t, b))
      bound by the inferred type for ‘g’: C a (t, b) => a -> t
      at tc168.hs:17:1-16
    The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
    When checking that ‘g’ has the inferred type
      g :: forall t b a. C a (t, b) => a -> t
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
