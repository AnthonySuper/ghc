    Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘_a’
      because type variable ‘a’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      an expression type signature: a
      at tcfail198.hs:6:36-41
    Relevant bindings include
      xs :: [_a] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:21)
      x :: _a (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:19)
      f3 :: [_a] -> [_a] (bound at tcfail198.hs:6:6)
    In the expression: x :: a
    In the second argument of ‘(++)’, namely ‘[x :: a]’
