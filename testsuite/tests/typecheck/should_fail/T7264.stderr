T7264.hs:13:19: error:
    Couldn't match type ‘a0’ with ‘forall r. r -> String’
    ‘a0’ is a rigid type variable bound by
         the inferred type of mkFoo2 :: a0 -> Maybe Foo at T7264.hs:13:1
    Expected type: a0 -> Foo
      Actual type: (forall r. r -> String) -> Foo
    Relevant bindings include
      val :: a0 (bound at T7264.hs:13:8)
      mkFoo2 :: a0 -> Maybe Foo (bound at T7264.hs:13:1)
    In the first argument of ‘mmap’, namely ‘Foo’
    In the expression: mmap Foo (Just val)
    In an equation for ‘mkFoo2’: mkFoo2 val = mmap Foo (Just val)
