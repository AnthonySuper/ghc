    Couldn't match type ‘_a’ with ‘forall r. r -> String’
      ‘_a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
           the inferred type of mkFoo2 :: _a -> Maybe Foo at T7264.hs:13:1
       Expected type: _a -> Foo
         Actual type: (forall r. r -> String) -> Foo
    Relevant bindings include
      val :: _a (bound at T7264.hs:13:8)
      mkFoo2 :: _a -> Maybe Foo (bound at T7264.hs:13:1)
    In the first argument of ‘mmap’, namely ‘Foo’
    In the expression: mmap Foo (Just val)
