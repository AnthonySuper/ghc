    Couldn't match type ‘Depend _s’ with ‘Depend s’
    NB: ‘Depend’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘_s’ is ambiguous
       Expected type: Depend s -> Bool
         Actual type: Depend _s -> Bool
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘check’:
      check :: forall s. Bug s => Depend s -> Bool
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘check’:
      check :: (Bug s) => Depend s -> Bool
