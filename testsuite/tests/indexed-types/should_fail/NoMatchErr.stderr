    Couldn't match type ‘Memo d’ with ‘Memo _d’
    NB: ‘Memo’ is a type function, and may not be injective
    The type variable ‘_d’ is ambiguous
       Expected type: Memo d a -> Memo d a
         Actual type: Memo _d _a -> Memo _d _a
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘f’:
      f :: forall d a. Fun d => Memo d a -> Memo d a
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘f’: f :: (Fun d) => Memo d a -> Memo d a
