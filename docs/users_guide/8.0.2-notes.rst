Release notes for version 8.0.2
===============================

TODO FIXME

Highlights
----------

-  Many, many bug fixes.

Full details
------------

Language
~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

-  :ghc-flag:`-XStaticPointers` now allows the body of the ``static`` form to
   refer to closed local bindings. For instance, this is now permitted:
   ``f = static x where x = 'a'``.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

-  The :ghc-flag:`-Wredundant-constraints` flag has been removed from the
   :ghc-flag:`-Wall` flag set (see :ghc-ticket:`10635`).

-  Added :ghc-flag:`-fdefer-out-of-scope-variables`, which converts variable
   out of scope variables errors into warnings.

Template Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  TODO FIXME.

- ``addModFinalizer`` now exposes the local typing environment at the splice
  point. This allows ``reify`` to see local and top-level definitions in the
  current declaration group when used as in

  .. code-block:: none

      f x = $(addModFinalizer (reify 'x >>= runIO . print) >> [| x |])

``ghc`` library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Accessors are now exposed for ``ErrUtils.ErrMsg`` and ``ErrUtils.ErrDoc``.
